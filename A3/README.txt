I don't think I properly did the recursive rendering for problem 1

For problem 2, 
go to g-dewar.github.io if localhost isn't set up

press R to reset view/blocks(positions only)
press C to add another block
press P to turn the blocks on
press O to turn the blocks off
click and drag to rotate view
and ARROW KEYS/MOUSE WHEEL to zoom
